# plotorder

Automate download of Chia plots from
[Chia Factory](https://chiafactory.com) service.

It's using [Chia Factory API](https://chiafactory.com/api/) and streamlines
whole download process.

## Requirements

Binaries are published for `Windows`, `Darwin` (macOS, OSX...) and `Linux` based operating systems with 64bit architectures. You can also build `plotorder` for other OS/arch very easily. Check out the `Makefile` for examples (see [this](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment) for available OS/arch compile targets)
